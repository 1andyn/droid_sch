{"name":"UH Manoa Scheduler Application","tagline":"Android App for creating Schedules of Courses for UH Manoa Students (w/ data pulled from Class Availability Website)","body":"### UH Manoa Scheduler Application\r\nThis application is an app developed on the Android platform that provides an alternative method of viewing course data from Manoa's Class Availability webpage. Currently student's from UH Manoa have to visit [this](https://www.sis.hawaii.edu/uhdad/avail.classes?i=MAN) webpage in order to view which courses are available for the selected semester. The student then has to manually for time conflicts when picking which courses they want to take. Our application automates this process. The student can use our app to select a semester, create a list of courses, and our application will automatically produce all the possible schedules a student can take for the semester. Our application also produces a time block visualization of what the schedule looks like\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/04aYkUuS--VpTprXM1Sy-hz7AngMwIYg3V7Hg_8bG3K10_Fd2RCr3iFFZY3THJdZMw=h900-rw\" width=\"150\" height=\"268\" />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bgND5fieyDaKEfJvcUtAOiP2n2AG7gOD6BH8vNtaENN4zzkWM_CLxaj5XxuxQf-b_Q=h900-rw\" width=\"150\" height=\"268\" />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/idxdgKgQt_I-QI6cX7hxEIpWMFkyDXfcb-reDlyiAuxYLdFjwdmbcrMMF4pc0xxGwuM=h900-rw\" width=\"150\" height=\"268\" />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ibUBxtQfdqQBTO4tf-WW3NpX-LXELr0v90S04nXGTRFjXwO-OWCtJAxdjdUTs4noeLo=h900-rw\" width=\"150\" height=\"268\" />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qf7HKmxELWDWK7JAWvnMczmkug2L5n1knx6cIJxQ9rUouP-WqNrMOsxwF1yTWCT-1ko=h900-rw\" width=\"150\" height=\"268\" />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pqSQ2JQkObTeLnKl0nlOA-SWo8EzfxJAU8ssGHVYXU29V5xfUzdEN2KUo6EfxmK5aVmF=h900-rw\" width=\"150\" height=\"268\" />\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NNzY9Kk.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"268\" />\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/RfXMKWl.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"268\" />\r\n\r\n### Google Play\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/223408/screenshots/984648/google_play_logo_002_002_1x.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\"/>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThe application is currently published on the Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uhmanoa.droid_sch).\r\n\r\n### Functionality\r\nOur application is separated into five main activities:\r\n- Builder Activity (for building schedules)\r\n- Viewer Activity (for viewing saved schedules)\r\n- Search Activity (for searching for searching for courses)\r\n- Preferences Activity (for configuration schedule options)\r\n\r\n### Improvements the App Could Use\r\n- Better utilization of larger screens (tablet support)\r\n- Improve the search activity intuitiveness; the search activity also does not efficiently display lots of data\r\n- Provide a metric system for scoring produced schedules to aid students when picking schedules to save. (e.g. based on free time between courses)\r\n- Improve performance of the builder function (perhaps thread the function)\r\n- Change the method of course retrieval data; James and I were unable to get the ITS department to provide us with a solid method of course data retrieve (e.g. JSON) since we both were graduating while working the project. Future students, please see if you guys can change this!\r\n\r\n### Authors, Contributors & Support\r\nThe original developers of the project are Andy Ng @lbkmono and James Hartman @surfsnowpro. Our project is open source so if you are a student at UH who wishes to work on the project feel free to clone our project or ask James or I for permission to contribute to the original repository. Although we can still support the application and fix bugs in our free time, we likely have other higher priority things to deal with since we have graduated :^)  \r\n\r\n### Contribute\r\nThe Project is open source, released under the GNU GPL v2 license. Feel free to fork the repo and start your own project based on our app or if you want to contribute directly to the main repository feel free to contact either of us for permission and contact me @lbkmono specifically for publishing the application onto the Google Playstore so I can add you as a developer to publish the app (or so I can take down our current version if you wish to publish your own app)! \r\n\r\n## Cloning\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/lbkmono/droid_sch\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
